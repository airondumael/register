Registration Form
===
A simple registration form. [DEMO](http://airondumael.github.io/register/)

How to use.
---
Because this is just a simple registration form didn't bother to create gulp/grunt tasks for bundling and just use cli of webpack and uglify and put the scripts in npm package.json. 

Just run one of the script below and open index.html (simply opening it will work but you may also use http server)

Dev (bundle and watch)
```bash
npm run dev
```

Build (bundle and uglify)
```bash
npm run build
```
